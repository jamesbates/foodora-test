Foodora test specialdays-to-schedule migration and restore CLI
==============================================================

Introduction
------------
This command-line tool will allow you, in emergencies, to implement the "SpecialDays"
feature of the Foodora application (https://gist.github.com/leandrolages/8224f94a6539f62c0360)
by temporarily setting all restaurants' regular schedule according to the special days information.

It is intended purely as a quick-and-dirty hack, and comes a substantial number of caveats
(see section "Usage"). We strongly suggest trying it out on a db copy first, to ensure that the
intended migration took place.

Prerequisites
-------------
In order to run this tool, you will need a recent (>= 5.6) version of PHP installed, with the following
features enabled:
- CLI
- PDO
- MySQL driver

You will obviously also require a database instance, containing the Foodora schedule application you
wish to "fix".

Configuration
-------------
To allow the tool to connect to the database, you will need to configure access to it in the app_configuration.ini file.
In the [database] section, you must define the values 'dbhost', 'dbname', 'username' and 'password' to values which
are appropriate for your environment. Consult your DB admin if you are unsure.

Database
--------
The current Foodora database contains no schema management. This tool requires adding a table to the database in order to
store backup schedules which will be overwritten when activating the "SpecialDays". This allows restoration of the regular
schedule, once the special days period is over.

In order to know whether the backup table needs to be created, schema management was introduced into the database. The
'schemas' subfolder of this project contains the required DDL to be executed for schema upgrades, and the tool will
run all required updates upon startup.

If after using this tool during the special days period, you no longer need it, you may safely remove the "db_schema"
and "vendor_schedule_backup" tables which these DDL scripts create.

Usage
-----
When all prerequisites are met, and you have properly configured DB access, you can run the tool as follows:

php run.php -activate

This will scan the "SpecialDays" of each vendor, and updates its regular schedule based on the defined SpecialDays.

Once the special days period is over, you can restore the previously defined schedule for each vendor, by calling:

php run.pgp -restore

Caveats
-------
As stated in the introduction, this tool is a quick and dirty workaround for a missing, or erroneous implementation of the
"SpecialDays" feature.

When activating the special days, this tools WILL NOT check the current date. This means that WHATEVER the current date, all
vendors' regular schedule WILL BE OVERWRITTEN with any special days defined for that vendor.

So if you have special defined for e.g. 24.12.2015 for a vendor, then that vendor's regular Thursday schedule WILL BE OVERWRITTEN,
regardless of WHEN you execute the command. It is up to you to ensure that the activation occurs during the correct time period.

When activating a special days schedule, the regular schedule for that vendor is overwritte. The regular schedule that was present
before is backed up in a separate table, so it can be restored later. As a result, if you activate the special days A SECOND TIME,
original backup up vendor schedule will be LOST (since you will have overwritten it with the special days schedule).
